# Welcome to My Website
> This is a test page to demonstrate various Markdown and MDX elements.

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal corner of the internet! This page demonstrates various Markdown and MDX elements.

## Text Formatting

Here's some **bold text** and *italic text*. You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ and `inline code`.

## Links and Images

Here's a [link to my GitHub](https://github.com/IMCurie).

<div className="relative w-24 h-24">
  <Image
    src="/avatar.jpg"
    alt="User avatar"
    className="rounded-full object-cover"
    fill
    quality={100}
  />
</div>

## Code Blocks

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return true;
}
```

## Blockquotes

> The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
>
> -- Eleanor Roosevelt
